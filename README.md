## Data Source
The data folder contains all needed datasets, including raw datasets and organized datasets. The main file Final_MRT_with_ridership.csv is a combination of cleaned data from different sources in the raw data folder. Inside data/raw_data, there are four sub-datasets: ridership, tourist, transport_mode_train, and weather_data. The cleaning procedure is included within each individual file with their data.

## Model
This project includes three baseline models and one optimization method. Three models (LSTM, GNN, GNN_transformer) are listed in their own files, which can be downloaded as .ipynb files. Explanations and required environments are written in their individual README.md files inside each folder. The same applies to MOPSO, which is the optimization method.
